# Field
A wrapper around [React Final Form's 'Field'](https://final-form.org/docs/react-final-form/api/Field).
Like the original, it "consumes" all the props related to field configuration and forwards all other props to its component/render function while subscribing it to the form state.
<!-- In particular, note that these forwarded props can override the input props,
like `onChange` or `onBlur`, which will interfere with how `final-form` works; -->
<!-- if you pass overrides, make sure you know how to register the changes you want with the form API. -->

## Cactus Props and additions

- The 'type' prop has been updated with Cactus components. e.g. `type="multiSelect"` uses the `SelectField` component.
    - For a custom field, pass the component via the `as` prop or via [children](https://final-form.org/docs/react-final-form/types/FormProps#children), [component](https://final-form.org/docs/react-final-form/types/FormProps#component), or [render](https://final-form.org/docs/react-final-form/types/FormProps#render).
      `as` is an alias of `component`, to fit in better with all the [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) we use in Cactus Web.

It also has two additional props:

- `getFieldComponent` is a function that accepts the props object and returns a valid component: either a string e.g. "input" or a functional or class component. It's only called if no render function or `component` prop is given, and is called _before_ the base Field, so it doesn't have access to any `final-form` data.
- `processMeta` is a function that takes two arguments: the props (including the `input` props from [the base Field](https://final-form.org/docs/react-final-form/types/FieldRenderProps) merged with the forwarded props), and the `meta` object from the base Field. It should return a single object containing the final version of the props to be passed to the component/render func.
  - Note that although it's not named as such `processMeta` does follow the rules of hooks, so you can use hooks in whatever function you pass here.
  - One possibility is to use `React.useContext(I18nContext)` from `@repay/cactus-i18n` to implement translated labels/error messages for your fields.

The biggest difference in the output is that all render methods receive the same props.
React Final Form's `Field` passes `input` and `meta` to a render func or component,
but if the `component` is a string it just merges the `input` directly into the props and drops `meta`.
Since we allow customizing how the props are merged using `processMeta`,
we just always merge the props into a single object and pass that to the component/render func
regardless of whether the component is an HTML element (string) or custom component.

### Configuration

Perhaps the most important difference to React Final Form's `Field` is the configuration of
defaults for certain props, under the assumption that most fields in a project will work similarly.
The configuration looks like this in Typescript:

```
// You can actually use any props accepted by `Field`, but these are the most useful to configure.
interface FieldProps {
  getFieldComponent?: (props: Record<string, any>) => React.ElementType;
  // `FieldMetaState` is from React Final Form, ref `FieldRenderProps`.
  processMeta?: (props: Record<string, any>, meta: FieldMetaState) => Record<string, any>;
  // `FieldSubscription` is from Final Form, ref `registerField`.
  subscription?: FieldSubscription;
}

// Sets new config options, and returns the old config.
Field.configureDefaults = (defaults: FieldProps) => FieldProps

// Creates a new component with the given defaults.
Field.withDefaults = (defaults: FieldProps) => FunctionalComponent<FieldProps>

// Returns the original config, as defined in the Cactus Form library.
Field.initialDefaults = () => FieldProps
```

The `initialDefaults` is mostly provided so it can be extended without having to rewrite it entirely, and returns something like the following:

```
Field.initialDefaults = () => ({
  subscription: {
    value: true,
    error: true,
    touched: true,
    submitError: true,
    modifiedSinceLastSubmit: true,
  },

  // Note the commonalities between the subscription and what's used here.
  processMeta: (props, meta) => {
    const error = (meta.touched && meta.error) || (!meta.modifiedSinceLastSubmit && meta.submitError)
    if (error && !props.error) {
      props.error = error
    }
    return props
  },

  getFieldComponent: (props) => {
    switch (props.type) {
      // Omitted for brevity: maps to Cactus Web, e.g. "date" -> DateInputField
      default:
        return TextInputField
    }
  },
})
```

Both `configureDefaults` and `withDefaults` work by setting the `defaultProps`
property on the function they're attached to.
The main difference is scope: `configureDefaults` applies to the `Field` component itself,
and thus applies to the entire project (including uses of `DependentField`);
`withDefaults` makes a new component that can be used on a single form or type of form,
if it's somewhat different than how forms normally behave on the site.

### Example use case of withDefaults to have errors be always visible.
```
const FieldWithAlwaysVisibleErrors = Field.withDefaults({
  subscription: { value: true, error: true },
  processMeta: (props, { error }) => ({ error, ...props }),
})
```

### Example use case of withDefaults and processMeta


The below example creates a new instance of the Field component that uses `withDefaults` and `processMeta` to add an asterisk to the Field label when `required` is passed.
```
const defaults = Field.initialDefaults()


export default Field.withDefaults({
  ...defaults,
  processMeta: (props, meta) => {
    if (props.required && props.label) {
      props.label = (
        <>
          {props.label}
          <span aria-hidden>*</span>
        </>
      )
    }
    // eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-non-null-assertion
    return defaults.processMeta!(props, meta)
  },
})

```


### Validation

One other default behavior that differs from the base Field is that if a `required` prop is passed,
but there is no `validate` function, one will automatically be set.
It basically checks that the value is not falsy or an empty array, though literal `0` and `false` are both allowed.
This validator is also available separately:

```
import { validateRequired } from '@repay/cactus-form'
```

You can also define custom required error messages with the `requiredMsg` prop. Both strings and React nodes are acceptable:

```
<Field required requiredMsg="Required Field" {...fieldProps} />
```

```
<Field required requiredMsg={<div>Required Field</div>} {...fieldProps} />
```

To use `required` without the validator you'd need to pass an explicit `validate` function, like a noop (or use `configureDefaults`/`withDefaults` to set a default validator or default `requiredMsg`).

### Refs & Extensions

The `Field` component is explicitly defined as a functional component so it's relatively easy to extend.
That does mean, however, that you can't pass a `ref` prop to forward to the field.
There are several ways around this, but probably the easiest two are a render func and a wrapper:

```
const withRenderFunc = (
  <Field {...propsWithoutRef}>
    {(props) => (
      <MyField {...props} ref={myRef} />
    })
  </Field>
)
// Note that you can just call `Field` as a normal function,
// which is more efficient than creating another level of the component tree.
const FieldWithRef = React.forwardRef((props, ref) => Field({ ...props, ref }))
```
