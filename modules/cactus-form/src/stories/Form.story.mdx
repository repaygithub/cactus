# Form

A wrapper around [Form](https://final-form.org/docs/react-final-form/api/Form) that includes an empty subscription
by default. It will also include a basic render function and form reset function if neither `component` or `render`
props are provided. Because the subscription is empty by default, we recommend that you use spies (`FormSpy`, `FieldSpy`)
to hook into form state changes.

```
const submitFunction = () => { ... }

<Form onSubmit={submitFunction}>
  <Field name="power" type="number" />
  <button type="reset">
    Reset handler included in 'Form'
  </button>
</Form>
```

The only required props are children or a render function, and  `onSubmit` which you can read about [here](https://final-form.org/docs/react-final-form/types/FormProps#onsubmit).
