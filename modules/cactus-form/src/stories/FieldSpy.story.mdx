# FieldSpy

Basically the same as FormSpy, except augmented for use on a single field. 
It doesn't support the `onChange` prop that FormSpy has, and you indicate which field to watch with the `fieldName` prop:

```tsx
const spyOn = { value: true }
const MyForm = (props) => (
  <Form {...props}>
    <Field name="power" type="number" />
    <FieldSpy fieldName="power" subscription={spyOn}>
      {({ value }) => (
        <span>You have selected a power level of {value}.</span>
      )}
    </FieldSpy>
  </Form>
)
```
