# DependentField

`DependentField` is an extenstion of `Field`.
It creates a normal `Field`, then uses Final Form's `registerField` API to subscribe
to changes to the dependency fields.
The extra props look like this:

```
interface DependentFieldProps extends FieldProps {
  dependsOn: string | string[] | Record<string, DependencyConfig>;
  onDependencyChange?: (state: FieldState, props: FieldProps) => void
}

interface DependencyConfig {
  // The basic field subscription format, e.g. `value: true`
  [K in keyof FieldSubscription]?: boolean
  onChange?: (state: FieldState, props: FieldProps) => void
}
```

It's important to note that `dependsOn` is used in a `useEffect` hook to create the field subscriptions,
so to prevent unnecessary subscription turnover you should either use a constant or something like `useMemo`;
that caveat does _not_ apply to `onDependencyChange`, however.

If you pass the dependencies as a string or an array of field names, they will only subscribe
to `value` changes and will all use the same change handler;
you can still tell which field changed (for arrays) by looking at `state.name`.
The second dependency format allows more flexibility in the subscription and change handling.

The first argument to the change handler is the state of the field being watched;
it's the same as the state passed to the callback for `registerField`.
The second argument is the merged props of the `DependentField`; chances are the only
one you'll need is `onChange`, which you can use to update the DependentField's
value as the dependencies change.

```jsx
const MyForm = (props) => (
  <Form {...props}>
    <Field name="power" type="number" />
    <DependentField name="reaction" dependsOn="power" onDependencyChange={
      (state, { onChange }) => {
        onChange(state.value > 9000 ? 'unbelievable' : 'still good')
      }
    } />
  </Form>
)
```

`DependentField` also has the `configureDefaults` and `withDefaults` functions that `Field` has.
