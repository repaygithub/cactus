# Submit Button

The Submit Button is at it's core, a Button component rendered by a formSpy that disables it when there are validation errors, the form hasn't been touched, or if the form is submitting.

Note that this component isn't required. The form can still be submitted using a custom submit button.


### Try it out

export const code = `
  <Form onSubmit={() => {}}>{() => <form onSubmit={() => {}}>
    <Field id="field" />
  </form>} </Form>
`;
export const scope = { Field, Form };


<LiveProvider code={code} scope={{scope}}>
  <LiveEditor style={{}} />
  <LiveError />
  <LivePreview />
</LiveProvider>



### Example with changing SubmitButton text

```
const customProcessState = (props, state) => {
    props.disabled = props.disabled || state.hasValidationErrors || state.pristine
    props.loading = props.submitting || state.submitting
    props.children = state.submitting ? 'Submitting' : 'Submit'
  };

<SubmitButton 
  processState={customProcessState}
/>
```
The first two lines in customProcessState are part of the defult processState. 
If you want to keep them and add custom logic, you have to write them again (like below)
