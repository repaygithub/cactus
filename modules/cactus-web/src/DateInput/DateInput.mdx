# DateInput

The `DateInput` component is a cross-browser implementation of an `<input type="date" />` with a built in picker.

If `format` is not provided, the component will default to match the provided type.

| type       | assumed format     |
| ---------- | ------------------ |
| `date`     | `YYYY-MM-dd`       |
| `datetime` | `YYYY-MM-dd HH:mm` |
| `time`     | `HH:mm`            |

When `value` is provided as a prop (i.e. controlled), the value will be raised as a Date or string to match the provided type. For example, `onChange` will be called with a date string when `props.value` is also a string.

<DateInput id="date-input-uncontrolled" name="date" />

## Best practices

It is idiomatic React to "control" the value as described above.

It is best to use the `DateInputField` component instead of this more atomic level because it comes with accessibility baked in.

One should avoid changing the type on a rendered DateInput after intial render -- if this is necessary we recommend also providing the format.

## Basic usage

```jsx
<DateInput id="date-input" name="date" />
```

## Properties

<PropsTable of={DateInput} />
