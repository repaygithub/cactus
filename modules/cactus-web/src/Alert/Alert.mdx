# Alert

The `Alert` component is designed to provide user feedback. The alert is a rectangular shape providing the user a current status based on the icon and background color.

## Best practices

The `Alert` component should be used to provide users with feedback based on the user's status. The status can be success, error, warning, and info. The `Alert` component should be set to a general alert or a push notification alert. The general alert is larger in size than the push notifcation. The push notification alert has a button, on the top right side, and an onClick action should be set to handle the click event when implementing a push notification.

## Basic usage

TODO - brief description

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { Alert } from '@repay/cactus-web'
...
<Alert status="success" type="general">
  Message
</Alert>
```

## Properties

<PropsTable of={Alert} />
