# Tabs

A set of components that represent tabs for showing one piece of content at a time and swapping between which content is visible and which is hidden.

## Basic Usage

There are four components:
- `TabList` is the wrapper component around the tabs
- `Tab` is the visual "button" that triggers the visible switch
- `TabController` is a context provider that can automate some of the accessibility functions for tabs by keeping track of the active tag and setting ARIA attributes accordingly
- `TabPanel` is basically just a `Box`, or a div with styling options, but when used with `TabController` it sets visibility and some of the accessibility props automatically

### Try it out

export const code = `
<Box border="1px solid black" height="175px">
  <TabController id="idPrefix" initialTabId="idPrefix-rank-tab">
    <TabList fullWidth fillGaps justifyContent="space-evenly">
      <Tab name="name">Name</Tab>
      <Tab name="rank">Rank</Tab>
      <Tab name="serial">Serial #</Tab>
    </TabList>
    <TabPanel tab="name" mx={5} my={4}>
      <h1>Nebby Nebulous</h1>
    </TabPanel>
    <TabPanel tab="rank" mx={5} my={4}>
      <h2>Cloudy Nebula</h2>
    </TabPanel>
    <TabPanel tab="serial" mx={5} my={4}>
      <p>N3BU14</p>
    </TabPanel>
  </TabController>
</Box>
`

<LiveProvider code={code} scope={{ Box, Tab, TabController, TabList, TabPanel }}>
  <LiveEditor style={livePreviewStyle} />
  <LiveError />
  <LivePreview />
</LiveProvider>

### Accessibility/Display

ARIA roles are set on the components automatically, so you only have to be aware of a few things:

- `TabController`
  - The `id` prop serves as a prefix for auto-generated IDs, as well as the default `id` for the `TabList` (since there's no DOM element associated with the controller)
  - The `initialTabId` prop has to be the full ID, not just the tab name; auto-generated IDs have the format `${controller.id}-${tabName}-tab` (replace "tab" with "panel" for TabPanel IDs)
- `TabList`
  - It's basically a flex container which fully exposes the `justifyContent` prop; you can also control the `flex-grow` CSS property of all the tabs at once using the `fillGaps` prop
  - `aria-orientation` can be horizontal or vertical, though the styles/functionality of vertical are not entirely complete at this point
- `Tab`
  - `aria-selected` should be true for the current tab and false for all others (set by controller)
  - `panelId`/`aria-controls` should be the ID of an element with the "tabpanel" ARIA role; set by controller/can be auto-generated from `name` prop
- `TabPanel`
  - `tabId`/`aria-labelledby` should be the ID of an element with the "tab" ARIA role; set by controller/can be auto-generated from `tab` prop
  - `hidden` should be set on all but the currently active tab; set by controller

The IDs are critical to ensure the link between tabs and panels, so be sure to always set the `id`/`panelId` on tabs and `id`/`tabId` on panels (or the `tab`/`name` shortcut if you're using the controller to auto-generate IDs).

## Properties

### TabList

<PropsTable of={TabList} staticProp="TabList" />

### Tab

For some reason our doc generator won't work on this component. The only two custom props are `name` and `panelId` mentioned above in the "Accessibility" section; both are optional strings.

### TabController

<PropsTable of={TabController} staticProp="TabController" />

### TabPanel

<PropsTable of={TabPanel} staticProp="TabPanel" />
