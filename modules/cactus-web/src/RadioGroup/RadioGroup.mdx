# RadioGroup

`RadioGroup` is a wrapper for a group of radio buttons, styled so that it fits in with and behaves like other field types (e.g. `TextInputField`).

## Basic Usage

`RadioGroup` is used like other `AccessibleField` derivatives, except that the individual radio buttons are passed as children. The `name`, `required`, and `disabled` props are passed to the `RadioGroup` and forwarded to the individual buttons; the first three are unconditional, but `disabled` is only forwarded if it is `true` (so that you can disable individual buttons if needed).

`RadioGroup.Button` is a straight wrapper around `RadioButtonField`, with the `name`, and `required` props removed so they can be omitted without causing Typescript errors.

### Try it out

export const code = `<RadioGroup name="radioCity" label="Here there be radios" value="option_b">
  <RadioGroup.Button label="Radio The First" value="option_a" />
  <RadioGroup.Button label="Radio The Second" value="option_b" />
  <RadioGroup.Button label="Radio The Third" value="option_c" />
</RadioGroup>`

<LiveProvider code={code} scope={{ RadioGroup }}>
  <LiveEditor style={livePreviewStyle} />
  <LiveError />
  <LivePreview />
</LiveProvider>

## Best practices

- Use meaningful labels to ensure accessibility.
- Prop forwarding for `name`, etc., will only work if the buttons are direct children of the group (or inside a `React.Fragment`, array, etc.). If you use an intermediate component, it will need to accept the forwarded props and pass them on in turn.
- You can control the selected value in one of two ways (which should not be mixed):
  - You can pass `value` or `defaultValue` to the group.
  - You can pass `checked` or `defaultChecked` to individual buttons.
  - This also works by prop forwarding, and has a similar caveat: if the child has a `value` prop that matches the group's `value` prop, a `checked` prop is added (and similarly for `defaultValue`/`defaultChecked`); **if the child has no `value` prop the group's `value` is forwarded,** so keep that in mind if you need a radio button with no value or have an intermediate component.
- A `ref` passed to `RadioGroup` will be set on the `<fieldset>` HTML element that wraps the group.
- The `onChange`, `onFocus`, and `onBlur` handlers are _not_ forwarded to the individual buttons; they are attached to the `<fieldset>` and rely on event delegation to capture changes.
  - This especially impacts the focus handlers, because when switching from one button to the next within the group, you'll get a blur event for the first button followed by a focus event for the second.

## Properties

<PropsTable of={RadioGroup} includeProps={['name', 'label', 'disabled', 'tooltip', 'error', 'warning', 'success']} />
