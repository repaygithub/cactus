# ColorPicker

The `ColorPicker` is a form element designed to allow a user to select a color with hex, rgb, or hue and saturation sliders.

### Try It Out

export const code = `
  <ColorPicker id="my-picker" name="color" />
`

<LiveProvider code={code} scope={{ ColorPicker }}>
  <LiveEditor style={livePreviewStyle} />
  <LiveError />
  <LivePreview />
</LiveProvider>

## Best practices

- Pass a meaningful name and ID
- Use the `phrases` prop to set text & labels. This object should contain any of the following keys, although all are optional.
  - `hexLabel`: Defaults to "Hex".
  - `redLabel`: Defaults to "R".
  - `greenLabel`: Defaults to "G".
  - `blueLabel`: Defaults to "B".
  - `triggerLabel`: Label for the palette icon button. Defaults to "Click to open the color picker".
  - `applyLabel`: Defaults to "Apply".
  - `cancelLabel`: Defaults to "Cancel".

## Basic usage

- If the hex input rendered outside the popup is changed, `onChange` will be called as soon as a valid hex string is set.
- If the color is changed using any of the elements in the popup, `onChange` will only be called when the apply button is clicked.
- If the cancel button is clicked, the color picker's state will revert to whatever value is passed through the props.
- The `ColorPicker` value can be controlled with any of the following types of values:
  - Hex string - ex: `00FF00` or `#00FF00`
  - HSL object - Hue should stay between 0 and 360 while saturation and lightness should stay between 0 and 1. ex: `{ h: 120, s: 1, l: 0.5 }`
  - HSV object - Hue should stay between 0 and 360 while saturation and value should stay between 0 and 1. ex: `{ h: 120, s: 1, v: 1 }`
  - RGB object - All values should be between 0 and 255. ex: `{r: 0, g: 255, b: 0}`
