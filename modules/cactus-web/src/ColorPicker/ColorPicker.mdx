# ColorPicker

The `ColorPicker` is a form element designed to allow a user to select a color with hex, rgb, or hue and saturation sliders.

### Try It Out

export const code = `
  <ColorPicker id="my-picker" name="color" />
`

<LiveProvider code={code} scope={{ ColorPicker }}>
  <LiveEditor style={livePreviewStyle} />
  <LiveError />
  <LivePreview />
</LiveProvider>

## Best practices

- Pass a meaningful name and ID
- Use the `phrases` prop to set text & labels

## Basic usage

- The `ColorPicker` value can be controlled with a hex string or with a hsl, hsv, or rgb color object.
- If the hex input rendered outside the popup is changed, `onChange` will be called as soon as a valid hex string is set.
- If the color is changed using any of the elements in the popup, `onChange` will only be called when the apply button is clicked.
- If the cancel button is clicked, the color picker's state will revert to whatever value is passed through the props.

## Properties

<PropsTable of={ColorPicker} />
