# Dimmer

The `Dimmer` component helps by attenuating any distraction to focus the attention on a specific Component. It works by darkening the entire page and displaying their child component over the darkened area.

## Basic usage

The only thing that you have to do is implement the Dimmer and pass the content as as child. At the moment the `Dimmer` only works with one boolean prop `active` and it is `false` by default.

When `active` is `true`, the content inside the Dimmer will be displayed over a full-page darkened area.

```js
import React, { useState } from 'react'
import { Dimmer } from '@repay/cactus-web'

export default () => {
  const [open, setOpen] = useState(false)

  //...Your implementation to manage if the Dimmer is active or not (By default should not be)

  return (
    <Dimmer active={open}>
      {
        //...Content
      }
    </Dimmer>
  )
}
```
