# Dimmer

The `Dimmer` is used to attenuate distractions and focus the attention on a specific component.
It normally works by darkening the entire page and displaying their child component over the darkened area;
it has a second mode with absolute positioning that can be used to cover just one section of a page.

## Basic usage

Dimmer has one required prop: `active`. When it is false, neither the Dimmer nor any of its children are rendered.
When true, the Dimmer's content will be rendered in the center of a darkened overlay.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react'
import { Dimmer } from '@repay/cactus-web'

export default () => {
  const [open, setOpen] = useState(false)
  return (
    <Dimmer active={open}>
      <Content />
    </Dimmer>
  )
}
```

To set the overlay over a single section of the page, just change the `position` prop.
You can also change the opacity to make it less obtrusive; this could be used,
for example, to indicate data in a DataGrid is being loaded without being too visually loud.

```jsx
<Box position="relative"
  <Dimmer active={isFetching} position="absolute" opacity="0.2">
    <Spinner />
  </Dimmer>
  <DataGrid {...dataProps} />
</Box>
```

## Properties

<PropsTable of={Dimmer} staticProp="Dimmer" />
