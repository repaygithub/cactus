# Grid

A responsive grid component designed to help lay out items on a page based on screen size breakpoints.

## Best practices

The maximum number of columns available per row is 12, but the number of columns you should use varies depending on screen size. See the table below for details.

| **Breakpoint** | **Max. Number of Columns**       |
| -------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `tiny`         | 4                                |
| `small`        | 6                                |
| `medium`       | 8                                |
| `large`        | 12                               |
| `extraLarge`   | 12                               |

## Basic usage

Our grid is based on a 12-column system and you can pass different values for different screen breakpoints. The number you pass corresponds to how many columns the item should occupy.
For instance, passing `tiny={3}` to `Grid.Item` is a way of saying that item should occupy 3/12 columns.

If a column size for a certain breakpoint isn't defined, `Grid` will always use the next lowest size that *is* defined. For example, the items in the grid below
only define `tiny` and `large` sizes. If the viewport had a width of 1050px, that would fall under the `medium` breakpoint, but since that isn't defined, the grid
will use the column size provided for `tiny`. If the screen grew to 1500px wide, that would fall under the `extraLarge` breakpoint, and the grid would arrange the
columns using the definitions for `large`.

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { Box, Grid } from '@repay/cactus-web

const renderGrid = () => (
  <Grid>
    <Grid.Item tiny={6} large={3}>
      <Box width="100%" height="25px" />
    </Grid.Item>
    <Grid.Item tiny={6} large={3}>
      <Box width="100%" height="25px" />
    </Grid.Item>
    <Grid.Item tiny={6} large={3}>
      <Box width="100%" height="25px" />
    </Grid.Item>
    <Grid.Item tiny={6} large={3}>
      <Box width="100%" height="25px" />
    </Grid.Item>
  </Grid>
)
```
