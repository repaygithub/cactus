# Table

Essentially just a table with styling to match the theme. Any valid HTML table layout should work, with a couple of exceptions:

- `rowSpan` is not really supported (but `colSpan` _is_ supported)
- Using multiple `tbody` elements is supported but because rows have odd-even styling, a `tbody` with an odd number of rows followed by another `tbody` will put two odd-styled rows next to each other.

## Basic Usage

The `Table` component has a few helpful sub-components:
- `Table.Cell` - a `td` element by default, but `as="th"` can be used to change that. It also has an `align` prop which directly translates to the CSS `text-align` property.
- `Table.Header` - a `thead` with a single row; because the row is included in the element, the direct children should be table cells. Within the `Header` the default cell type switches from `td` to `th`, but can still be overridden using `<Table.Cell as="td">`.
- `Table.Row` - a `tr` element.
- `Table.Body` - a `tbody` element.

### Scroll Wrapper

By default the table is rendered in a div with `overflow-x: auto`.
In most use cases this makes fitting a table into a site layout easier, regardless of the table's contents;
however there are some cases where you may not want the wrapper.
In particular, putting a table in a flex or grid container may result in strange sizing behavior
unless you pass `width: 100%` to match the table size to the wrapper;
or for greatest flexibility you can use the `noScrollWrapper` prop to remove the wrapper entirely.

```jsx
<Flex>
  <Flex.Item flex="1 1 400px" as={Table} noScrollWrapper>
    <Table.Header>
    ...
  </Flex.Item>
</Flex>
```

### Card Carousel

In addition to the default styling, there is another style of table that is more suitable for mobile devices. In this mode each row is rendered as a "card", where the cells are rendered as rows within the card. The cards are arranged horizontally and can be scrolled (or swiped) side-to-side, even if the scroll wrapper is removed.

There are two ways of controlling card carousel mode: using the `variant` prop, or the `cardBreakpoint` prop. `variant` has the highest precedence: if passed as `variant="table"`, the card carousel will never be used; if passed as `variant="card"`, it will always be used. The `cardBreakpoint` prop can be used to transition between table mode and card mode at one of the theme's CSS media queries, but it will only work if the app is using a `ScreenSizeProvider`. For example, the following table would be in card mode for "tiny" or "small" screen sizes, and table mode for anything larger:

```jsx
<ScreenSizeProvider>
  <Table cardBreakpoint="small">
    ...
  </Table>
</ScreenSizeProvider>
```

If a `Table.Header` is used, card mode will also render the headers in each cell/row so the user doesn't have to remember which header lines up with which cell.

### Sticky Column

For the default styling, there is the possibility to set the right most column right to be sticky. This column stays in place as the user scrolls through the table. For enabling this feature, the `Table` component allows a `sticky` prop that currently accepts `none` or `right` values.

```jsx
<ScreenSizeProvider>
  <Table sticky="right">
    ...
  </Table>
</ScreenSizeProvider>
```

### Try it out

export const code = `
<Table>
  <Table.Header>
    <Table.Cell colSpan="2">Spanned Header</Table.Cell>
    <Table.Cell>Another Column</Table.Cell>
  </Table.Header>
  <Table.Row>
    <Table.Cell as="th">SubHeader</Table.Cell>
    <Table.Cell>SubValue</Table.Cell>
    <Table.Cell align="right">Another Value</Table.Cell>
  </Table.Row>
  <Table.Row>
    <Table.Cell align="center" colSpan="2">Spanned SubHeader</Table.Cell>
    <Table.Cell align="right">That One Value</Table.Cell>
  </Table.Row>
</Table>
`

<LiveProvider code={code} scope={{ Table }}>
  <LiveEditor style={livePreviewStyle} />
  <LiveError />
  <LivePreview />
</LiveProvider>

## Properties
