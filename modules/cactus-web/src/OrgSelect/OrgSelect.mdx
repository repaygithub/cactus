# OrgSelect

The `OrgSelect` is a component designed to show the current organization's info as well as make it easy to search and switch between orgs.

## Basic usage

`OrgSelect` will render a search box at the top, the current org info (if it's provided through the `currentOrg` prop), and a list of all orgs.
If a user types in the search box, the component will filter through the list of orgs and display only the ones that match the search.

The `OrgSelect` can be controlled or uncontrolled -- if you don't pass any `onChange` prop to the component, then it will filter orgs for you. However, if you
want to handle the filtering yourself, you can pass an `onChange` handler that will be called whenever the search value changes. If you pass an `onChange` handler,
make sure to update the list of orgs and pass the updated list through the `orgs` prop.

## Try It out

export const code = `
<OrgSelect
  orgs={[
    { name: 'Org 1', id: '1234', subdomain: 'org-1' },
    { name: 'Org 2', id: '1243', subdomain: 'org-1' },
    { name: 'Org 3', id: '2134', subdomain: 'org-3' }
  ]}
  currentOrg={{ name: 'Org 1', id: '1234', subdomain: 'org-1' }}
  onOrgClick={(org) => console.log(org.name + ' clicked')}
/>
`

<LiveProvider code={code} scope={{ OrgSelect }}>
  <LiveEditor style={livePreviewStyle} />
  <LiveError />
  <LivePreview />
</LiveProvider>

## Best practices

- The `OrgSelect` was designed to be rendered inside a dropdown; the `BrandBar.Dropdown` in particular is the best place to use it.
- If you pass an `onChange` you must update the orgs passed to the `orgs` prop yourself.
- Organizations are expected to be objects with the form: `{ name: string, id: string, subdomain: string }`.
