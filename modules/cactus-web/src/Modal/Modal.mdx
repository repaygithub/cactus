# Modal

The `Modal` component acts just as a container, and is usefull when no action from the user is required.

### Try it out

export const code = ` () => {
  const [modalOpen, setModalOpen] = React.useState(false)
  return modalOpen ? (
    <Modal
      variant="action"
      isOpen={modalOpen}
      onClose={() => setModalOpen(false)}
      modalLabel="Modal Label"
      closeLabel="Close Label"
    >
      <Text as="h1">This is a Modal</Text>
    </Modal>
  ) : (
    <Button variant="action" onClick={() => setModalOpen(true)}>
      Open Modal
    </Button>
  )
}`

<LiveProvider code={code} scope={{ Modal, Button, Text }}>
  <LiveEditor style={livePreviewStyle} style={livePreviewStyle} />
  <LiveError />
  <LivePreview />
</LiveProvider>

## Best practices

The `Modal` component locks all other user interactions on the web page until the user takes an action.
It acts as a container that can contain any children the developer wants to put in it.

It also has `modalLabel` and `closeLabel` props which act as aria-labels for the modal and close icon.
Modal width is responsive by default, but may be overridden with the `width` prop. If the modal's width is
set manually, device responsiveness must also be taken into account to ensure compatibility with devices of differing sizes.

## Basic usage

A basic modal is just an empty container. In this example it has a `Text` component as the only child

```jsx
import { Modal } from '@repay/cactus-web'
const ComponentWithModal = () => {
  const [modalOpen, setModalOpen] = useState(false)
  return (
    <Modal
      variant="action"
      isOpen={modalOpen}
      onClose={() => setModalOpen(false)}
      modalLabel="Modal Label"
      closeLabel="Close Label"
    />
  )
}
```

## Properties
