# Accordion

## Best practices

- If you need to group accordions together, make sure to place them inside the `Accordion.Provider` component, as it provides the keyboard accessibility features
for groups of accordions.

## Basic usage

You can use a single Accordion by itself:

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { Accordion } from '@repay/cactus-web'

const SingleAccordion = props => {
  return (
    <Accordion>
      <Accordion.Header>
        My Header
      </Accordion.Header>
      <Accordion.Body>
        Accordion Content Goes Here
      </Accordion.Body>
    </Accordion>
  )
}
```

You can also use `Accordion.Provider` to display multiple Accordions at the same time, and the Provider will manage their open/closed states for you:

When using `Accordion.Provider`, you can set the maximum number of Accordions that can be open at the same time using the `maxOpen` prop, which defaults to 1.

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { Accordion } from '@repay/cactus-web'

const MultipleAccordions = props => {
  return (
    <Accordion.Provider maxOpen={2}>
      <Accordion>
        <Accordion.Header>
          My Header 1
        </Accordion.Header>
        <Accordion.Body>
          Accordion Content Goes Here
        </Accordion.Body>
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion>
        <Accordion.Header>
          My Header 2
        </Accordion.Header>
        <Accordion.Body>
          Accordion Content Goes Here
        </Accordion.Body>
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion>
        <Accordion.Header>
          My Header 3
        </Accordion.Header>
        <Accordion.Body>
          Accordion Content Goes Here
        </Accordion.Body>
      </Accordion>
    </Accordion.Provider>
  )
}
```
