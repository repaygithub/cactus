# SplitButton

The `SplitButton` component is a combination of a button and a dropdown and it is useful for providing a user with
some actions to take. It consists of a main action button and any number of other actions that can be displayed by the dropdown.

## Try It Out

export const code = `
<SplitButton>
  <SplitButton.Action onClick={() => console.log('Main Action')}>Main Action</SplitButton.Action>
  <SplitButton.Action onClick={() => console.log('Action 1')}>Action 1</SplitButton.Action>
  <SplitButton.Action onClick={() => console.log('Action 2')}>Action 2</SplitButton.Action>
</SplitButton>
`

<LiveProvider code={code} scope={{ SplitButton }}>
  <LiveEditor style={livePreviewStyle} />
  <LiveError />
  <LivePreview />
</LiveProvider>

## Best practices

- The `SplitButton` should be used when there are many distinct possible actions, but only one primary action which
is likely to be used the most, as opposed to the `MenuButton`, which is used to offer multiple ways of carrying out a
single action.
- Pass `aria-label` to `SplitButton` to provide the dropdown trigger with an accessible label.

The main action can be specified in one of two ways:
- By passing the `main={true}` prop to any SplitButton.Action
- If no actions have the `main` prop, the first action in the list becomes the main action.
