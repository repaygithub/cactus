# Layout

Component that represents a web site's main responsive layout. It's specifically designed for use with Cactus components, but can be customized via the `useLayout` hook.

The site's main content should be wrapped in `Layout.Content`; for example, if using a routing library that's where you would put the router so that changing pages doesn't affect the menu, etc.

## Basic Usage

Acceptable children from cactus-web are:

- BrandBar
- MenuBar
- ActionBar
- Layout.Content
- Footer

All the children except `Layout.Content` are optional, though ActionBar is highly recommended. If included, they should be included in the listed order, and as direct children.

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { ActionBar, BrandBar, Footer, Layout, MenuBar } from '@repay/cactus-web'
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Switch, Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom'
import Home from './Home'
import Customer from './Customer'

const LOGO = 'https://mysite.com/logo'

const MySite = () => (
  <Router>
    <Layout>
      <BrandBar logo={LOGO} />
      <MenuBar>
        <MenuBar.Item as={Link} href="/home">Teenage Mutant</MenuBar.Item>
        <MenuBar.Item as={Link} href="/other/path">Ninja Turtles</MenuBar.Item>
      </MenuBar>
      <ActionBar />
      <Layout.Content>
        <Switch>
          <Route path="/home">
            <Home />
          </Route>
          <Route path="/other/path">
            <Customer />
          </Route>
        </Switch>
      </Layout.Content>
      <Footer logo={LOGO}>The Foot clan returns.</Footer>
    </Layout>
  </Router>
)
```

## Properties

`Layout` takes no props aside from `children`.

## Layout Customization with `useLayout`

The Layout component provides a CSS grid that can be customized with the `useLayout` hook:

```
function useLayout(role: string, position: Position, order: number = 0): string;
type Position = FixedPosition | GridPosition

type GridLine = number | string | undefined
type Dimension = GridLine | GridLine[]
interface FixedPosition {
  fixed: 'top' | 'left' | 'bottom' | 'right'
  size: number
}
interface GridPosition {
  grid?: 'header' | 'footer' | 'left' | 'right' | 'component'
  width?: Dimension
  height?: Dimension
  row?: GridLine
  rowSpan?: GridLine
  rowEnd?: GridLine
  col?: GridLine
  colSpan?: GridLine
  colEnd?: GridLine
}
```
The `role` serves as an ID to apply the layout styles, and as such should be unique within your app.
The `position` specifies where on the screen your component should appear,
and the `order` is used to decide which order the components should appear in
if they are in the same area, e.g. the grid header.
The return value is a string containing CSS classes that should be applied to an element:
- `cactus-layout-[role]`: this class actually applies the positioning styles.
- `cactus-[type]-[key]`, e.g. `cactus-fixed-bottom` or `cactus-grid-header`; this is useful for applying styles to descendents, especially in components like the ActionBar where the position changes based on screen size.

Obviously, this hook must be called from a component rendered as a descendant of the Layout component. Additionally, while a fixed component can be rendered from anywhere, a grid component must create an element that is a direct child of the layout div in the DOM, according to the rules of CSS grid.

### Fixed Positioning

Components with fixed positioning are placed outside the main layout, and the edges
of the layout grid are adjusted according to the given `size` so they don't overlap.
For example, `{ fixed: 'right', size: 43 }` moves the _right edge_ of the layout grid
43 pixels in, and places the fixed element in the resulting blank space.

If there are multiple fixed components, they are applied in `order`:
two `top` components will move the grid's top edge by the sum of their sizes,
and then one will have the style `top: 0; height: [sizeA];`, and the other
will have the style `top: [sizeA]; height: [sizeB];`.
If there's partial overlap, they'll be interleaved: if a left is ordered before a top,
then left will have the style `left: 0; width: [sizeL];`
and top will have the style `left: [sizeL]; top: 0; height: [sizeT];`.

### Grid Positioning

The grid positioning can be used to place components anywhere in a CSS grid;
as such it provides a great deal of flexibility, but can also be messed up easily.
- _grid_ allows you to specify a shortcut type; defaults to `component`, i.e. a general grid item with no special defaults.
- _width_ and _height_ are the dimensions of the grid.
  - They are used to generate the `grid-template-columns` & `grid-template-rows` CSS properties, respectively.
  - They can be numbers (pixel lengths) or CSS grid lengths, e.g. "1fr" or "min-content".
  - If the grid item spans multiple rows/columns, use arrays to pass multiple lengths.
  - If several grid items span the same row/column, only one of them needs to specify the length: the others can leave it undefined.
  - If several grid items assign different lengths to a particular row/column, you'll get a message from `console.warn`.
- _row_ and _col_ are the starting grid lines.
  - They default to the next row/column in order: e.g. adding two grid items to column 1, but leaving row undefined, the first item will go to row 1 and the second item will go to row 2.
  - Like regular CSS grid you can specify negative numbers: e.g. -1 is the last grid line, -2 is second-to-last, etc.
  - You can also specify the role of another layout component: e.g. `row: 'logo'` would cause an item to start from the same grid line as the component with the "logo" role.
- _rowSpan_ and _colSpan_ specify how many rows/columns the grid item spans.
  - Defaults to 1.
  - Specifying a layout role will cause this item to _use the same end line_ as the given grid item: e.g. if grid item "menu" goes from grid line 3 to grid line 5, `rowSpan: 'menu'` would be equivalent to `rowEnd: 5`.
- _rowEnd_ and _colEnd_ are the ending grid lines.
  - Should be used instead of, not alongside, `rowSpan` & `colSpan`.
  - Defaults to undefined.
  - Specifying a layout role will cause this item to _end on the start line_ of the given grid item: e.g. if grid item "menu" goes from grid line 3 to grid line 5, `rowEnd: 'menu'` would be equivalent to `rowEnd: 3`.
  - This is a bit confusing, but just remember: `rowSpan: 'menu'` _spans_ the menu rows, while `rowEnd: 'menu'` _ends at_ the menu row.

Role names and negative grid lines are considered _relative grid lines_ and have some caveats compared to undefined/positive grid lines.
Because the grid is calculated in a single pass, you cannot define a grid item relative to another relative grid item:
to use something like `row: 'main'`, the layout item with role "main" _must_ have
its `row` & `rowSpan` or `rowEnd` either undefined or positive integers.
(Undefined works because the defaults for row/col/rowSpan/colSpan are all positive integers.)
Also, the `width` & `height` dimensions are ignored when their respective grid lines are relative,
because there's no way to know in advance which rows/columns the dimensions apply to.

#### Grid Shortcuts

To make common layouts simpler, it has four "shortcut" types:
- header and footer components appear at the top and bottom respectively.
  - The `width` dimension is ignored; `height` defaults to "min-content".
  - `row`, `rowSpan`, and `rowEnd`, if provided, should be positive integers.
  - `col` defaults to 1, and `colEnd` defaults to -1; in other words, spanning all columns.
- left and right components appear at the left and right respectively.
  - The `height` dimension is ignored; `width` defaults to "min-content".
  - `col`, `colSpan`, and `colEnd`, if provided, should be positive integers.
  - `row` and `rowSpan` both default to `main`, i.e. they occupy the same row(s) as the component with the "main" role.
  - Defaults only work if there _is_ a component with the "main" role (such as `Layout.Content`).

### Built-in Cactus Layout

Just for comparison purposes, these are the layouts of Cactus's built-in layout components.

- BrandBar: grid header
- MenuBar: grid header (only on large screens; otherwise rendered on the ActionBar)
- ActionBar differs by screen size:
  - _tiny_: fixed bottom
  - _small & medium_: fixed left
  - _large+_: grid left
- Layout.Content: grid component, specifies width & height to fill all space unused by other items
- Footer: grid footer
