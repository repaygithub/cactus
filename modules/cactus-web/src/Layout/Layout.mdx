# Layout

Component that represents a web site's main responsive layout. It's specifically designed for use with cactus components; that may change in the future, but for now the code is relatively simple to copy & adapt if you wish for more custom layouts.

The site's main content should be wrapped in `Layout.Content`; for example, if using a routing library that's where you would put the router so that changing pages doesn't affect the menu, etc.

## Basic Usage

Acceptable children are:
- BrandBar
- MenuBar
- ActionBar
- Layout.Content
- Footer

All the children except `Layout.Content` are optional, though ActionBar is highly recommended. If included, they should be included in the listed order, and as direct children.

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { ActionBar, BrandBar, Footer, Layout, MenuBar } from '@repay/cactus-web'

const LOGO = "https://mysite.com/logo"

const MySite = () => (
  <Layout>
    <BrandBar logo={LOGO} />
    <MenuBar>
      <MenuBar.Item>Teenage Mutant</MenuBar.Item>
      <MenuBar.Item>Ninja Turtles</MenuBar.Item>
    </MenuBar>
    <ActionBar />
    <Layout.Content>
      <h1>Latin Or Something</h1>
      <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.</p>
    </Layout.Content>
    <Footer logo={LOGO}>The Foot clan returns.</Footer>
  </Layout>
)
```

## Properties

`Layout` takes no props aside from `children`.
