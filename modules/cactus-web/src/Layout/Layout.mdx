# Layout

Component that represents a web site's main responsive layout. It's specifically designed for use with cactus components; that may change in the future, but for now the code is relatively simple to copy & adapt if you wish for more custom layouts.

The site's main content should be wrapped in `Layout.Content`; for example, if using a routing library that's where you would put the router so that changing pages doesn't affect the menu, etc.

## Basic Usage

Acceptable children are:

- BrandBar
- MenuBar
- ActionBar
- Layout.Content
- Footer

All the children except `Layout.Content` are optional, though ActionBar is highly recommended. If included, they should be included in the listed order, and as direct children.

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { ActionBar, BrandBar, Footer, Layout, MenuBar } from '@repay/cactus-web'
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Switch, Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom'
import Home from './Home'
import Customer from './Customer'

const LOGO = 'https://mysite.com/logo'

const MySite = () => (
  <Router>
    <Layout>
        <BrandBar logo={LOGO} />
        <MenuBar>
          <MenuBar.Item as={Link} to="/home">Teenage Mutant</MenuBar.Item>
          <MenuBar.Item as={Link} to="/other/path">Ninja Turtles</MenuBar.Item>
        </MenuBar>
        <ActionBar />
        <Layout.Content>
            <Switch>
              <Route path="/home">
                <Home />
              </Route>
              <Route path="/other/path">
                <Customer />
              </Route>
            </Switch>
        </Layout.Content>
        <Footer logo={LOGO}>The Foot clan returns.</Footer>
      </Layout>
    </Router>
  )
)
```

The `Router` inside `Layout.Content` is used to navigate between different pages and components.
Depending on the library, the MenuBar may also need to be connected to the Router so that links will work.

## Properties

`Layout` takes no props aside from `children`.
