# Layout

Component that represents a web site's main responsive layout. It's specifically designed for use with cactus components; that may change in the future, but for now the code is relatively simple to copy & adapt if you wish for more custom layouts.

The site's main content should be wrapped in `Layout.Content`; for example, if using a routing library that's where you would put the router so that changing pages doesn't affect the menu, etc.

## Basic Usage

Acceptable children are:

- BrandBar
- MenuBar
- ActionBar
- Layout.Content
- Footer

All the children except `Layout.Content` are optional, though ActionBar is highly recommended. If included, they should be included in the listed order, and as direct children.

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { ActionBar, BrandBar, Footer, Layout, MenuBar } from '@repay/cactus-web'
import { Router } from '@reach/router'
import Home from './Home'
import Customer from './Customer'

const LOGO = 'https://mysite.com/logo'

const MySite = () => (
  <Layout>
    <BrandBar logo={LOGO} />
    <MenuBar>
      <MenuBar.Item>Teenage Mutant</MenuBar.Item>
      <MenuBar.Item>Ninja Turtles</MenuBar.Item>
    </MenuBar>
    <ActionBar />
    <Layout.Content>
      <Router>
        <Home path="/home">Home </Home>
        <Customer path="/other/path">Customer</Home>
      </Router>
    </Layout.Content>
    <Footer logo={LOGO}>The Foot clan returns.</Footer>
  </Layout>
)
```

The `Router` inside `Layout.Content` is used to navigate between different pages and components.
Note that `Home` and `Customer` are made-up components, just to show you the functionality.
Also, we use `@reach/router` in this example, but you are free to use any routing library that you want.

## Properties

`Layout` takes no props aside from `children`.
