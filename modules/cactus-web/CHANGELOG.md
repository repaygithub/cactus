# v4.0.0-beta.0 (Fri Nov 13 2020)

#### üí• Breaking Change

- Several updates and fixes to the `Breadcrumb` component
[#358](https://github.com/repaygithub/cactus/pull/358) ([@mikesoltow](https://github.com/mikesoltow))
  - The label prop of Breadcrumb.Item is no longer accepted.  Please put the text for
each Breadcrumb.Item in children instead.
  - The `BreadCrumbItem` component has been renamed to `BreadcrumbItem` for consistency.
  - The colors of the Breadcrumb.Item links now pull from the theme.  In addition, the
color now changes when the links are hovered, and a custom border appears when the links are
focused.
  - The linkTo prop of Breadcrumb.Item no longer exists.  If not using the "as" prop,
then you must replace linkTo with "href".
- Change form field event handlers for easier integration with form libraries
[#360](https://github.com/repaygithub/cactus/pull/360) and
[#366](https://github.com/repaygithub/cactus/pull/366) ([@wilysword](https://github.com/wilysword))
  - The `onChange`, `onFocus`, and `onBlur` props of the following components now use
standard React change and focus event handling functions instead of custom Cactus functions:
CheckBoxField, CheckBoxGroup, RadioButtonField, RadioGroup, TextAreaField, TextInputField,
Toggle, and ToggleField.
  - The Toggle component now uses the `checked` prop instead of `value`.
  - The `onChange`, `onFocus`, and `onBlur` props of the following components now use event
handling functions with custom events instead of the custom Cactus functions: DateInput,
DateInputField, FileInput, FileInputField, Select, and SelectField.
- Fix bug where `aria-describedby` would reference non-existent IDs in form field
components [#379](https://github.com/repaygithub/cactus/pull/379) ([@mikesoltow](https://github.com/mikesoltow))
  - The `ariaDescribedBy` field returned by `useAccessibleField` will now return `undefined`
if the DOM element should not have an `aria-describedby` attribute.
- Improvements to the Footer component [#369](https://github.com/repaygithub/cactus/pull/369)
([@NicolasSimmonds](https://github.com/NicolasSimmonds))

content to fill the viewport.

  - If no `children` are provided to the Footer, then the Footer links will now be
displayed in the top section, and no bottom Footer section will be displayed.
  - The color of the Footer links has been altered to ensure accessibility if they are
displayed in the top section.
  - The underline for the Footer links will now disappear when hovered.
  - The Footer will no longer be in a fixed position at any screen size.
