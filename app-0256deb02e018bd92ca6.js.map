`onCreateWebpackConfig`. The configuration sets the loader to handle its\n * own file, so if we import `./loaders/mdx-components`, the `mdx-components`\n * loader handles loading itself.\n *\n * # Why does this work?\n * The loader doesn't use the file argument to itself and instead returns\n * a generated file that includes the `gatsby-config` mdxPlugins wrapped in\n * require() statements. This results in the `mdxPlugins` being required\n * and available to the code after this import.\n *\n * # Have a better solution to this?\n * Submit a PR\n */\nimport { plugins as mdxPlugins } from \"./loaders/mdx-components\";\nimport scopeContexts from \"./loaders/mdx-scopes\";\n\nconst componentsAndGuards = {};\n\nconst componentFromGuards = arr =>\n  function GatsbyMDXComponentFinder(props) {\n    const { Component } = arr.find(\n      ({ guard }) => (guard ? guard(props) : true)\n    );\n    return <Component {...props} />;\n  };\n\nmdxPlugins.forEach(({ guards = {}, components }) => {\n  Object.entries(components).forEach(([componentName, Component]) => {\n    if (componentsAndGuards[componentName]) {\n      componentsAndGuards.push({ guard: guards[componentName], Component });\n    } else {\n      componentsAndGuards[componentName] = [\n        { guard: guards[componentName], Component }\n      ];\n    }\n  });\n});\n\nconst components = Object.entries(componentsAndGuards)\n  .map(([name, arr]) => ({\n    [name]: componentFromGuards(\n      arr.concat({ guard: undefined, Component: name })\n    )\n  }))\n  .reduce((acc, obj) => ({ ...acc, ...obj }), {});\n\n// merge any components in wrapRootElement above this wrapRoot\nconst MDXConsumer = withMDXComponents(\n  ({ components: componentsFromContext, children }) => (\n    <MDXScopeProvider __mdxScope={scopeContexts}>\n      <MDXProvider components={{ ...componentsFromContext, ...components }}>\n        {children}\n      </MDXProvider>\n    </MDXScopeProvider>\n  )\n);\n\nconst WrapRootElement = ({ element }) => <MDXConsumer>{element}</MDXConsumer>;\n\nexport default WrapRootElement;\n","import wrap from \"./wrap-root-element\";\nexport const wrapRootElement = wrap;\n","import React from 'react'\n\nimport { FieldOnChangeHandler, Omit } from '../types'\nimport { MarginProps, margins } from '../helpers/margins'\nimport Label from '../Label/Label'\nimport RadioButton, { RadioButtonProps } from '../RadioButton/RadioButton'\nimport styled from 'styled-components'\nimport useId from '../helpers/useId'\n\ninterface RadioButtonFieldProps extends Omit<RadioButtonProps, 'id' | 'onChange'>, MarginProps {\n  label: string\n  name: string\n  labelProps?: object\n  id?: string\n  onChange?: FieldOnChangeHandler<string>\n}\n\nconst RadioButtonFieldBase = (props: RadioButtonFieldProps) => {\n  const { label, labelProps, id, className, name, onChange, ...radioButtonProps } = props\n  const radioButtonId = useId(id, name)\n  const handleChange = React.useCallback(\n    (event: React.FormEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {\n      if (typeof onChange === 'function') {\n        const target = (event.target as unknown) as HTMLInputElement\n        onChange(name, target.value)\n      }\n    },\n    [name, onChange]\n  )\n\n  return (\n    <div className={className}>\n      <RadioButton id={radioButtonId} name={name} onChange={handleChange} {...radioButtonProps} />\n      <Label htmlFor={radioButtonId} {...labelProps}>\n        {label}\n      </Label>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nexport const RadioButtonField = styled(RadioButtonFieldBase)`\n  & + & {\n    margin-top: 8px;\n  }\n\n  ${Label} {\n    cursor: ${p => (p.disabled ?
