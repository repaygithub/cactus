# Cactus Framework Design Principles

## 1. Avoid Premature Abstraction

The Cactus Framework inherently exerts control over the methods and way your application is implemented, however it should only provide specific implementations when consensus has been reached. If a feature is inherently complex or varies greatly in practice, it should not be provided explicitly by `@repay/cactus-fwk` until the teams have coalesced around an implementation.

## 2. Encourage Best Practices

The framework should encourage best practices including accessibility, performance, readability, and testability.
