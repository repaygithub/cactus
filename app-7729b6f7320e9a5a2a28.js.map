`onCreateWebpackConfig`. The configuration sets the loader to handle its\n * own file, so if we import `./loaders/mdx-components`, the `mdx-components`\n * loader handles loading itself.\n *\n * # Why does this work?\n * The loader doesn't use the file argument to itself and instead returns\n * a generated file that includes the `gatsby-config` mdxPlugins wrapped in\n * require() statements. This results in the `mdxPlugins` being required\n * and available to the code after this import.\n *\n * # Have a better solution to this?\n * Submit a PR\n */\nimport { plugins as mdxPlugins } from \"./loaders/mdx-components\";\nimport scopeContexts from \"./loaders/mdx-scopes\";\n\nconst componentsAndGuards = {};\n\nconst componentFromGuards = arr =>\n  function GatsbyMDXComponentFinder(props) {\n    const { Component } = arr.find(\n      ({ guard }) => (guard ?
