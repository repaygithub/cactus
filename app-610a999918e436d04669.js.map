None of the state is changed outside of user events.\n//\n// There are a few features that are important to understand.\n//\n// 1. Tooltips don't show up until the user has rested on one, we don't\n//    want tooltips popupping up as you move your mouse around the page.\n//\n// 2. Once any tooltip becomes visible, other tooltips nearby should skip\n//    resting and display immediately.\n//\n// 3. Tooltips stick around for a little bit after blur/mouseleave.\n//\n// TODO: Research longpress tooltips on Android, iOS\n// - Probably want to position it by default above, since your thumb\n//   is below and would cover it\n// - I'm thinking after longpress, display the tooltip and cancel any click\n//   events. Then on touchend, so they can read it display the tooltip for\n//   a little while longer in case their hand was obstructing the tooltip.\n\n/* eslint-disable default-case */\n\nimport React, { Fragment, cloneElement, Children, useState, useRef, forwardRef, useEffect } from \"react\";\nimport { useId } from \"@reach/auto-id\";\nimport { wrapEvent, checkStyles, shouldIgnoreTooltips } from \"@reach/utils\";\nimport Portal from \"@reach/portal\";\nimport VisuallyHidden from \"@reach/visually-hidden\";\nimport { useRect } from \"@reach/rect\";\nimport { node, string, func } from \"prop-types\";\n\n////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n// ~The states~\n\n// nothing goin' on\nvar IDLE = \"idle\";\n\n// we're considering showing the tooltip, but we're gonna wait a sec\nvar FOCUSED = \"focused\";\n\n// IT'S ON\nvar VISIBLE = \"visible\";\n\n// Focus has left, but we want to keep it visible for a sec\nvar LEAVING_VISIBLE = \"leavingVisible\";\n\n// The user clicked the tool, so we want to hide the thing, we can't just use\n// IDLE because we need to ignore mousemove, etc.\nvar DISMISSED = \"dismissed\";\n\nvar chart = {\n  initial: IDLE,\n  states: (_states = {}, _states[IDLE] = {\n    enter: clearContextId,\n    on: {\n      mouseenter: FOCUSED,\n      focus: VISIBLE\n    }\n  }, _states[FOCUSED] = {\n    enter: startRestTimer,\n    leave: clearRestTimer,\n    on: {\n      mousemove: FOCUSED,\n      mouseleave: IDLE,\n      mousedown: DISMISSED,\n      blur: IDLE,\n      rest: VISIBLE\n    }\n  }, _states[VISIBLE] = {\n    on: {\n      focus: FOCUSED,\n      mouseenter: FOCUSED,\n      mouseleave: LEAVING_VISIBLE,\n      blur: LEAVING_VISIBLE,\n      mousedown: DISMISSED,\n      selectWithKeyboard: DISMISSED,\n      globalMouseMove: LEAVING_VISIBLE\n    }\n  }, _states[LEAVING_VISIBLE] = {\n    enter: startLeavingVisibleTimer,\n    leave: function leave() {\n      clearLeavingVisibleTimer();\n      clearContextId();\n    },\n    on: {\n      mouseenter: VISIBLE,\n      focus: VISIBLE,\n      timecomplete: IDLE\n    }\n  }, _states[DISMISSED] = {\n    leave: function leave() {\n      // allows us to come on back later w/o entering something else first\n      context.id = null;\n    },\n    on: {\n      mouseleave: IDLE,\n      blur: IDLE\n    }\n  }, _states)\n};\n\n// chart context allows us to persist some data around, in Tooltip all we use\n// is the id of the current tooltip being interacted with.\nvar context = { id: null };\nvar state = chart.initial;\n\n////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n// Finds the next state from the current state + action.
