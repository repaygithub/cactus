# Forms

The Cactus Form library wraps [final-form](https://final-form.org) and `react-final-form`
to provide functionality commonly used in our designs, and fix a couple of "bugs"
that don't really appear in normal usage but do appear in the way our designs work.
We use `final-form` because it has a good feature set and flexibility,
while being more efficient when working on large forms than other options.
