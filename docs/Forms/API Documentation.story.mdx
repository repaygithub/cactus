# Cactus Form API Documentation

The Cactus-Form library is, for the most part, a wrapper around [React Final Form](https://final-form.org/docs/react-final-form/getting-started)
that integrates it with the various Cactus Modules. As such, the best way to use it is to familiarize yourself with both sets of documentation. Links have been added throughout this guide to the relevant sections of React Final Form.


We also add two new components:

- `DependentField` is like a `Field`, but takes a set of field names and a callback to use when any of those fields changes.
- `FieldSpy` is analagous to [FormSpy](https://final-form.org/docs/react-final-form/api/FormSpy), but for a single field.


## Important concepts:

- `subscription` is used for optimization. By default, the Form and all Fields will re-render any time the form state is changed, 
  but by subscribing the Form and Fields to different parts of the form state, you can optomize how the form re-renders as the user fills it out. 
  The form state can be accessed through `FormSpy` and `FieldSpy`.
