## Theming

The components in this library are designed to work with a theme that is generated using `@repay/cactus-theme` and given the `ThemeProvider` component created by [styled-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/styled-components). This will apply a color scheme to all of the components available in this library so that the design is standardized and complies with accessibility standards. If you would like a more detailed breakdown on how to generate and use a theme, see <a to="/theme">@repay/cactus-theme</a>.
