# Cactus Design System and Framework

An application framework and design system built in React at [REPAY](https://github.com/repaygithub).


## Getting Started

Whether you are starting a new project from scratch, or you are looking to integrate the Cactus libraries into your existing code base, we have documentation that can help. For documentation regarding our UI application generator, see the [@repay/create-ui docs](../Getting-Started/README.md). For guidance on using Cactus with an existing application, browse the module documentation and the example applications linked below. Feel free to browse our [tutorials](/tutorials) as well.

## Design System

The Cactus Design System is built to aid designers and developers to make decisions in layout and component usage in applications. The goal is to create better applications by making clear, consistent, intuitive, and reusable patterns. These patterns are then turned into distributable modules for developers to use directly.
